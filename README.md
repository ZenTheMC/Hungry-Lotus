# Hungry Lotus

PROBLEM: I have an avid passion for futurism and the technological singularity. Most people only see the doom and gloom with the future, whereas I see utopia.


SOLUTION: I created a store of the future with items that would give a glimpse into it and bring hope and optimism:

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** MERN Stack

-One of my freelance projects that I made for a business, for their restaurant website, based on their preferences and feedback.

## Optimizations (*Contributions Welcome*)

-Add new menu items when the restaurant comes up with them.

-Add online ordering experience, instead of just a display sight for the restaurant with contact info to order.

## Lessons Learned:

-New libraries for UI design

-With client projects, you have to wipe any personal preference and override it with the client's preference.
