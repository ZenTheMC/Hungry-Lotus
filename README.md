# Hungry Lotus

PROBLEM: A local Asian restaurant that I've been going to since I was a kid wanted a website built for their business.


SOLUTION: I took the contract and made them a website based on their specifications, keeping in close touch with the owner and iterating based on feedback:

|| A beautiful website for their Asian Restaurant ||

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** MERN Stack + Vercel

-One of my freelance projects that I made for a business, for their restaurant website, based on their preferences and feedback.

## Optimizations (*Contributions Welcome*)

-Add new menu items when the restaurant comes up with them.

-Add online ordering experience, instead of just a display sight for the restaurant with contact info to order.

-Integrate the testimonials, since 3 of them are already in the files, but not part of the page, and an additional feature that allows users to leave them(with authentication to prevent bad actors).

## Lessons Learned:

-New libraries for UI design

-With client projects, you have to wipe any personal preference and override it with the client's preference.

-How to set-up a mono-repo and deploy both the frontend and backend separately on Vercel
